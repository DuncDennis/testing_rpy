# testing_rpy

Personal repository to test [my fork](https://github.com/DuncDennis/reservoirpy) of the 
[ReservoirPy package](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy). 

If changes are made to my local clone of the fork, reinstall the package in the venv via 
```
pip install -e path/to/local/clone
```
